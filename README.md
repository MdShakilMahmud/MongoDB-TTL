# MongoDB-TTL

**MongoDB's TTL** (Time To Live) fully implemented with **_NodeJS_** and **_Express_**.

## Overview

MongoDB is one of the widely used NoSQL database. Sometimes we need to automatically remove documents from a collection after a certain amount of time or at a specific clock time. So here I show how to implement easily TTL indexes and configure it on demand with calling just a single API.

## Environment Variables

Create a **.env** file based on **_.env-example_** file.

## Installation & Local Run

Ensure you have node 10 or higher.

1. `npm install`
2. `PORT=<your_expected_port> npm run dev`

## Usage

[http://localhost:<your_expected_port>](http://localhost:<your_expected_port>)
